bst.c implements the dynamic operations on a binary search tree.
Treedepth() returns an integer with the depth, treeSize() returns an integer
with the number of elements in the tree. treeWalk prints out the numbers
in the tree in sorted order. All three "extra" functions can be found in bst.c
Testing can be found and executed in test.c using the testOps() function.
