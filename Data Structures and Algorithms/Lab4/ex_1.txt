Exercise 1 is to implement  a selection of functions for a graph data structure.
The chosen graph data structure was an adjacency matrix, which was very simple to understand
and use for the rest of the exercises, except in exercise 2. The functions are located in MatOps.c and are
tested in the testing() function in the file funcTest.c.
Testing was done out throughout the implementation. To test and verify, use the functions 
such as in testing() and observe the results.
